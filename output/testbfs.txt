Results of parts (a) and (b).
Format of the output is as follows:
Node #: node1, node2, ... nodeHospital
	Distance: <number of edges to nodeHospital>
If a node ID does not exist in the graph, or a node is not connected to any hospitals, their distances are recorded with a NIL.
If a node is a hospital node, the distance will be 0.

Node 0: 0
	Distance: 0
Node 1: No connection to any hospital found
	Distance: NIL
Node 2: 2, 8
	Distance: 1
Node 3: 3, 0
	Distance: 1
Node 4: 4, 7
	Distance: 1
Node 5: 5, 0
	Distance: 1
Node 6: 6, 0
	Distance: 1
Node 7: 7
	Distance: 0
Node 8: 8
	Distance: 0
Node 9: 9, 8
