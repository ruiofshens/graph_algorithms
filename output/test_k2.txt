Results of parts (c) and (d), with k = 2.
Format of the output is as follows:
Node #: <distance to nearest hospital>, <distance to 2nd nearest hospital>, ..., <distance to kth nearest hospital>
	Number of hospitals within reach: <number of hospitals reached>

If a node ID does not exist in the graph, their number of hospitals within reach are recorded as NIL.
If the value of k exceeds the number of hospitals reachable, the remaining distances are indicated with a -1.
If a node is a hospital node, the first distance will be 0.
